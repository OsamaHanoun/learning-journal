* Local Version Control maintains track of files within the local system.
* Centralized Version Control is way for a developer team to collaborate on a single file or set of files and this system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions.
* Distributed Version Control The clients completely clone the repository including its full history. If any server dies, any of the client repositories can be copied on to the server which help restore the server.
